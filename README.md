![Design preview for the 3-column preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is my first ever solution to a Frontend Mentor challenge, in particular to this challenge: 3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor.

I would love any feedbacks for this solution to improve my coding practices and learn best practices for HTML and CSS coding.
